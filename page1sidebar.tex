\cvsection{Noteworthy Project}

\cvevent{Real-time EMR message processing tool}{Proprietary}{June 2019 -- Present}{}
I participated in the architectural design and implementation of a tool that listens
for and processes messages sent from a production EMR system. This tool has been
deployed to several customers and is still being maintained in production today.
This tool is proprietary, so I cannot share the code, but am happy to discuss directly 
in more detail.
